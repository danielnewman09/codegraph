"""Tag-integrity tests for the doxygen-index dogfood graph.

Verifies the provenance-tag invariant that downstream consumers rely
on for the single-source dogfood graph (this repository's own
``src/codegraph_index``):

- Every node whose ``source`` is the project (``doxygen-index``) must
  carry the ``as-built`` tag — otherwise it would be invisible to
  ``LayerGraph.from_backend(..., "as-built")`` and to every view that
  selects project code by tag.
- Every node carrying the ``as-built`` tag must have the project
  ``source`` — there are no dependency sources in this graph, so the
  two sets must be *equal* (stronger than the cpp-sqlite suite, which
  must allow dependency-tagged one-hop neighbours).

These tests run against the fresh ingest produced by the
session-scoped ``codegraph_graph`` fixture, so they validate exactly
what the build writes to the backend (sqlite by default, Neo4j
opt-in via ``CODEGRAPH_BACKEND``).
