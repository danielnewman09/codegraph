"""Tag-integrity tests for the cpp-sqlite as-built graph.

Verifies the provenance-tag invariant that downstream consumers rely
on: when the cpp-sqlite source is indexed as the as-built graph, the
``source`` label and the ``as-built`` tag must agree *exactly*.

- Every node whose ``source`` is the project (``cpp-sqlite``) must
  carry the ``as-built`` tag — otherwise it would be invisible to
  ``LayerGraph.from_backend(..., "as-built")`` and to every view
  that selects project code by tag.
- Every node carrying the ``as-built`` tag must have the project
  ``source`` — otherwise dependency code (boost, sqlite3, spdlog,
  cppreference) would leak into the as-built view.

These tests run against the fresh ingest produced by the
session-scoped ``codegraph_graph`` fixture, so they validate exactly
what the build writes to the backend (sqlite by default, Neo4j
opt-in via ``CODEGRAPH_BACKEND``).
